Hi, my name is Minh Duc Pham (Phạm Minh Đức). This is my personal page where I share my academic journey and future orientation. Thank you for visiting !!!

I am currently a Master student in <strong>M2-Mechatronics, Machine Vision, and Artificial Intelligence</strong> at <i>Université Évry Paris-Saclay</i>. 

I have graduated with the Bachelor' Degree in <strong>Talent Program - Control Engineering and Automation</strong> at <i>Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST)</i>, where I have strong foundation in Control theory and experiences in Robotics systems as well as academic researches. I pursue Master's Degree to approach new knowleadge in Computer Visison and AI, which can be combined with my gackground in Control and Robotics for designing intelligent and safe robot systems in various complicated fields.

In the second semester of my Master 2 Program, I will undertake a full-semester internship. I am looking for internship opportunities in Université Paris-Saclay Community and far away, the PhD/industrial PhD positions in Robotics and Control Engineering with Computer Vision and AI, or relevant approaches. I am always open to exploring new areas and eager to challenge myself through research and collaboration.

<h2 style="font-size: 1.2em;">Description</h2>

My work focused on two main directions: robot navigation using ROS2 and reinforcement learning for intelligent control. In robot navigation, I explored obstacle avoidance and trajectory optimization for mobile robots and manipulators. In reinforcement learning, I experimented with both discrete and continuous environments, applying deep learning techniques to strategy games and navigation tasks to study how agents can learn effective movement and decision-making strategies.

For more information, you can refer to detailed description in [TEEP project](/portfolio/TEEP).

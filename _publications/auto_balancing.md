This is my first conference paper about Ballbot systems. Based on the popular Hierarchical Sliding Mode Control approach (HSMC), we designed a variation by combining HSMC with Fractional-order derivatives and radius basis function neutral networks to simply estimate the unknow components in 2D Ballbot model. The proof for system stability based on Lyapunov function are also presented, including numerical simulation on MATLAB/Simulink.

This conference paper presented the concept of Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC), another approach for controlling Ballbot systems which is expanded in the following publications. The most excellent advantages of NMPC is the ability to control based on predictions of system states after a certain period of time in the future. This method allows applying several system constraints in the optimazation problem and is suitable for complex control tasks such as obstacle avoidance or safe control.

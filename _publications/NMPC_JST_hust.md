This research represented the combination of Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) and Control Barrier Function (CBF). As mentioning in [NMPC_Benchmark](/publication/benchmark), NMPC allows applying several system constraints in the optimazation problem, including the Control Barrier Function. On the other hand, Control Barrier Function (CBF) is formulated based on a safe set of distance constraints and dynamic model instead of using the normal constraint that the distance from the ballbot to the obstacles is greater than the desired safe distance. These constraints ensure that the ballbot maintains a safe and consistent distance from every obstacle, thus preventing collisions. 

We also have another publication that improving this control method on Ballbot system in [NMPC_CBF_1](/publication/CBF_NMPC_ballbot).

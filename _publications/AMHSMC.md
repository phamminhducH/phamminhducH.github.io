This conference paper presented an Lyapunov-based concept for estimation directly the uncertain mechanism parameters of the systems. This method not only maintains the stability of conventional HSMC but also enhances the system's robustness by approximating parameters that directly affect model change. We also present the proof of system stability and some numerical simulation with changes in body's mass and center of inertia in 2D Ballbot system. However the application in the 3D model is not really good and need more improvement in the future.
